            "reply": "You\u0027re asking why `TestNGRunner` was added when other people run tests without that class — I\u0027ll explain the purpose, when it\u0027s useful, what alternatives exist, and give a couple of short examples and recommended next steps.\n\nChecklist\n- Explain why `TestNGRunner` exists (purpose + benefits) — Done\n- Show common alternatives (IDE/TestNG plugin, testng.xml, Maven/Gradle) — Done\n- Give short examples of programmatic and declarative runs — Done\n- Recommend what to do next (comment, remove, or keep) — Done\n\nWhy this class was created\n- `TestNGRunner` is a small helper that programmatically starts TestNG from a regular Java `main` method:\n  - Allows you to run TestNG as a plain Java application (e.g., Run -\u003e Java Application in your IDE).\n  - Useful for quick local runs and debugging tests without invoking Maven/Gradle or the TestNG plugin.\n  - Lets you configure TestNG dynamically (choose classes, suites, listeners, parallelism, output dir, etc.) at runtime.\n  - Handy if you need to integrate test execution into another Java program or a custom launcher.\n\nWhen it\u0027s useful\n- You want to debug tests in the IDE and step through test code and setup/teardown.\n- You need to select tests dynamically (build a list of classes based on runtime data).\n- You want to add programmatic listeners or change TestNG configuration before running.\n- You don’t want to maintain or edit a `testng.xml` file for ad-hoc runs.\n\nCommon alternatives (why others may not have this class)\n- testng.xml: declare suites and tests declaratively and run via IDE/TestNG plugin.\n- IDE/TestNG plugin: right-click a test class or suite and run — no extra launcher class required.\n- Maven/Gradle: `mvn test` or `gradle test` (managed by build tool / surefire / gradle plugin).\n- Running test classes directly: if the IDE supports TestNG it can run test classes annotated with `@Test` without a main.\n\nShort examples\n\n1) What your `TestNGRunner` does now (already in your repo)\n- It creates a TestNG instance, sets test classes, then runs:\n  - testng.setTestClasses(new Class[] { Childclass.class, ParentClass.class });\n  - testng.run();\n\n2) Programmatically run a `testng.xml` instead (if you prefer suites)\n- Example snippet:\n  - testng.setTestSuites(Collections.singletonList(\"src/test/resources/testng.xml\"));\n  - testng.run();\n\n3) Run via Maven (no custom launcher needed)\n- Use your `pom.xml` and run:\n  - mvn test\n- (Maven will execute tests through surefire/failsafe using TestNG configuration or annotations.)\n\nRecommendations / next steps\n- If you want to keep quick IDE-run / debug capability, keep `TestNGRunner` (maybe add a short javadoc comment above the class to explain its purpose).\n- If you prefer using `testng.xml` or Maven and want to reduce clutter, you can remove the file — but only do that if no one depends on the programmatic launcher.\n- I can:\n  - Add a one-line comment to `TestNGRunner` explaining why it exists, or\n  - Remove the file if you\u0027d like, or\n  - Convert it to use `testng.xml` programmatically (if that fits your workflow).\n\nWhich would you like me to do? If you want, I can add the javadoc comment right now.",
